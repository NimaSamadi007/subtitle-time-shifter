1
00:00:59,298 --> 00:01:00,698
What do you think
of Darren Jarvis?

2
00:01:00,858 --> 00:01:02,259
At CBS?

3
00:01:02,338 --> 00:01:03,692
He wants me to be
a correspondent.

4
00:01:03,778 --> 00:01:05,293
It's not
worth your time.

5
00:01:06,539 --> 00:01:08,179
What about Greer Fisher,
at MSNBC?

6
00:01:09,099 --> 00:01:11,774
Stick to writing,
do TV on the side.

7
00:01:11,858 --> 00:01:13,578
You're more than
a talking head.

8
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:16,533
How about <i>Slugline?</i>

9
00:01:16,658 --> 00:01:17,855
What's <i>Slugline?</i>

10
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:22,167
If I said <i>Politico</i> wanted to
hire me, what would you say?

11
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:23,932
I would say that
that piques my interest.

12
00:01:24,099 --> 00:01:26,057
Six months from now,
<i>Slugline</i> will be

13
00:01:26,179 --> 00:01:28,137
what <i>Politico</i> was
a year and half ago.

14
00:01:28,298 --> 00:01:29,414
Everyone at <i>Politico</i>
reads it

15
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,298
because <i>Slugline's</i> breaking
stories before they are.

16
00:01:31,378 --> 00:01:33,018
I wonder why I've
never heard of it.

17
00:01:33,099 --> 00:01:34,134
Everyone's
a free agent.

18
00:01:34,218 --> 00:01:36,733
And they write whatever they
want, wherever they are.

19
00:01:36,819 --> 00:01:38,378
Most people write
from their phones.

20
00:01:38,459 --> 00:01:41,453
Well, if freedom and exposure
are what they're offering,

21
00:01:41,578 --> 00:01:44,414
I would say that is
a meeting worth taking.

22
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:47,215
This Hammerschmidt
thing is blowing up.

23
00:01:47,298 --> 00:01:49,176
I think he might
get fired.

24
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:50,658
There's got to be
a thousand tweets here...

25
00:01:50,738 --> 00:01:53,173
People defending me,
people trashing me.

26
00:01:53,298 --> 00:01:55,608
There's even a hashtag,
GoZoe.

27
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:56,688
Hmm.

28
00:01:59,738 --> 00:02:00,730
Hey!

29
00:02:01,658 --> 00:02:02,730
We mustn't leave
any trails.

30
00:02:02,858 --> 00:02:03,896
All of my contacts
were in there.

31
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:07,417
Then it's time for you
to get some new contacts.

32
00:02:11,379 --> 00:02:13,530
Don't worry. I'll get you a phone.
I'll get you two, in fact.

33
00:02:13,618 --> 00:02:15,656
One for work
and a burner for play.

34
00:02:15,779 --> 00:02:17,498
Expect them
this afternoon.

35
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:22,409
Oh, and... Go, Zoe.

36
00:04:34,699 --> 00:04:35,735
The reporter?

37
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:36,896
Yes.

38
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:40,934
Just this once?

39
00:04:44,819 --> 00:04:46,379
I'm not sure.

40
00:04:47,619 --> 00:04:49,531
What does she offer us?

41
00:04:50,778 --> 00:04:52,293
A mouthpiece,
when we need one.

42
00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:54,098
She's been
very useful so far.

43
00:04:54,459 --> 00:04:56,052
What does she want?
Access.

44
00:04:56,138 --> 00:04:58,016
A seat at the table.

45
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,170
Sounds like she's getting the
better side of the bargain.

46
00:05:01,379 --> 00:05:03,211
She can be controlled.

47
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,778
Are you sure?

48
00:05:05,019 --> 00:05:06,295
She can.
I promise you.

49
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,412
Okay, if you say so.

50
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,977
The moment you
want me to end it...

51
00:05:12,059 --> 00:05:13,812
I know, Francis.

52
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,939
I should get
ready for work.

53
00:05:32,939 --> 00:05:34,009
Hey...

54
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,410
I didn't think
you'd be in until later.

55
00:05:36,499 --> 00:05:38,138
This is your
agenda for the day.

56
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,939
Here's your schedule
for the rest of the week.

57
00:05:40,019 --> 00:05:42,057
These are papers that need
to be approved or signed.

58
00:05:42,138 --> 00:05:44,131
Over here are your one-sheets
for committee meetings

59
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:47,257
and briefs on upcoming
legislative action.

60
00:05:47,338 --> 00:05:50,333
I filled Ashley in. She can cover
until you find a replacement.

61
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,449
Christina.

62
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:02,775
What?

63
00:06:06,379 --> 00:06:07,778
Thank you.

64
00:06:08,259 --> 00:06:10,819
For getting
all this in order.

65
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:19,540
Ashley can call me if you have any
questions about what's on your desk.

66
00:06:24,138 --> 00:06:25,175
He here yet?

67
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,336
I put him
in your office.

68
00:06:32,019 --> 00:06:34,898
Marty Spinella. Head lobbyist
for the teachers union.

69
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:37,415
He wants to rip my head off
and peel it like an orange.

70
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:40,293
Why? Because I lied to him.
But what choice did I have?

71
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:43,891
When the truth would have ended
the conversation before it began?

72
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,653
I'll call you back.
Marty.

73
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:49,412
You fucking lied, Frank?

74
00:06:49,499 --> 00:06:51,492
No, no, no.
You lie to my fucking face?

75
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:53,451
Marty, I did not lie. What
do you mean you did not?

76
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,213
We spent a whole
weekend in that room

77
00:06:55,379 --> 00:06:57,052
poring over this bill
line by line.

78
00:06:57,138 --> 00:06:59,973
And nowhere did it say anything
about collective bargaining.

79
00:07:00,059 --> 00:07:02,973
Let's calm down and sit down.
And we will discuss this.

80
00:07:03,059 --> 00:07:06,257
I will explain everything that's
going on and we will talk it out.

81
00:07:06,379 --> 00:07:07,973
No matter how long it takes.
No. No more.

82
00:07:08,059 --> 00:07:09,540
This is gonna be
a very short meeting.

83
00:07:09,619 --> 00:07:11,771
'Cause only one of two
things are going to happen.

84
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:14,891
Either you assure me right
now that amendment is out,

85
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:17,973
or I am walking out that door and I
am gonna start launching missiles.

86
00:07:18,059 --> 00:07:20,494
The amendment was never
intended to stay in the bill.

87
00:07:20,578 --> 00:07:21,899
It's just there for leverage.
That's all.

88
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:25,814
You threaten to cut federal funding
from union school districts?

89
00:07:25,899 --> 00:07:28,733
That's not a poker chip, Frank,
that's a goddamn dirty bomb.

90
00:07:28,819 --> 00:07:32,973
Look, the amendment
is not staying in the bill.

91
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:37,259
I just need you to work with
me on performance standards.

92
00:07:37,619 --> 00:07:38,848
Performance standards?

93
00:07:39,778 --> 00:07:42,295
Are you fucking kidding me? You
agreed that they were already out.

94
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,297
You can't just put it back in now, Frank.
Marty, look...

95
00:07:44,379 --> 00:07:46,177
I have a reputation
to uphold.

96
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:49,650
I am the one that made the
union reps stay here for you

97
00:07:49,778 --> 00:07:52,249
while you're in Gaffney playing
with your fucking Peachoid.

98
00:07:52,338 --> 00:07:53,456
Marty...
You tell me right now,

99
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,213
is that amendment
in or out?

100
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:59,939
There is a middle ground here, Marty.
We just have to find it.

101
00:08:02,019 --> 00:08:03,932
I take that as a no.

102
00:08:06,939 --> 00:08:08,168
Okay.

103
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:13,850
Marty, do not start a war
you know you're gonna lose.

104
00:08:13,939 --> 00:08:16,057
You fuck me,
I fuck back.

105
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,249
Stamper!

106
00:08:22,338 --> 00:08:24,649
Marty and I have a good
working relationship.

107
00:08:24,739 --> 00:08:25,730
Or used to.

108
00:08:25,819 --> 00:08:26,970
You could see
he has a temper,

109
00:08:27,059 --> 00:08:29,211
but I can usually cut through
that and reason with him.

110
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,451
But I may have pushed him too far.
Which is worrisome.

111
00:08:32,538 --> 00:08:34,848
Friends make
the worst enemies.

112
00:08:37,019 --> 00:08:38,850
How'd it go?
What'd you hear?

113
00:08:38,978 --> 00:08:42,050
A lot of fucks. Well,
that pretty much says it.

114
00:08:42,658 --> 00:08:43,978
Let's think
this through...

115
00:08:44,058 --> 00:08:45,288
No, we've got the DNC
leadership meeting.

116
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,726
What?

117
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:49,207
I'd say you could skip it, but
Birch just dumped it on us.

118
00:08:49,378 --> 00:08:51,654
When? It's here. In 12 minutes.

119
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,413
Why here and not
the DNC headquarters?

120
00:08:53,538 --> 00:08:56,692
The DNC is doing renovations, they're
gonna be green-energy efficient.

121
00:08:56,778 --> 00:08:59,657
That's a charming
use of party funds.

122
00:09:00,098 --> 00:09:02,408
We've only been in this
space about three months.

123
00:09:02,858 --> 00:09:04,008
It's cool.

124
00:09:04,098 --> 00:09:05,976
Not exactly
<i>The Herald,</i> is it?

125
00:09:06,058 --> 00:09:08,653
Have you been to those offices?
Yes.

126
00:09:08,778 --> 00:09:10,928
Wrist-slitting
was in order.

127
00:09:11,338 --> 00:09:13,649
So, who else
is courting you?

128
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:15,216
A few people.

129
00:09:15,338 --> 00:09:16,408
You mean everyone.

130
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:18,777
There were a lot of
emails this morning...

131
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:20,178
That's not surprising.

132
00:09:20,258 --> 00:09:22,726
You're having a moment,
people are interested.

133
00:09:22,818 --> 00:09:24,093
I'm one of them.

134
00:09:24,178 --> 00:09:26,851
But if eight minutes passes
on anything, I get bored.

135
00:09:26,978 --> 00:09:29,538
In eight minutes, I could be bored with you.
Unless you keep me interested.

136
00:09:30,938 --> 00:09:32,338
I think you can,

137
00:09:32,418 --> 00:09:33,774
and I think this
is the place for you

138
00:09:33,858 --> 00:09:36,009
to keep the rest of
the world interested, too.

139
00:09:36,418 --> 00:09:38,216
It's your call.
I won't chase you.

140
00:09:38,298 --> 00:09:39,652
I'm definitely tempted...

141
00:09:40,098 --> 00:09:42,055
Take as long as you
want to look around.

142
00:09:42,139 --> 00:09:45,097
Email me your figure. I'll
call you back with a counter.

143
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:54,051
This is our top priority. Ohio,
Florida and Pennsylvania.

144
00:09:54,818 --> 00:09:57,128
We need all of them or
Walker's a one-term president.

145
00:09:57,218 --> 00:09:59,813
Pennsylvania is why he picked
Matthews as a running mate.

146
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:01,730
But now we have to
find a replacement.

147
00:10:01,858 --> 00:10:03,656
The special election
is this November.

148
00:10:04,218 --> 00:10:06,370
Patricia Whittaker.
DNC chair.

149
00:10:06,538 --> 00:10:08,973
A rare example of someone
whose head is in the game

150
00:10:09,058 --> 00:10:10,856
instead of
up their backside.

151
00:10:10,938 --> 00:10:13,216
Competence is such an
exotic bird in these woods

152
00:10:13,378 --> 00:10:15,654
that I appreciate
it whenever I see it.

153
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,808
Now, this also
affects the House.

154
00:10:17,899 --> 00:10:19,572
The new Governor will
oversee redistricting.

155
00:10:19,658 --> 00:10:20,853
We lose seats here,

156
00:10:20,938 --> 00:10:22,418
that means we could lose
our majority in Washington.

157
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:25,697
Well, the RNC is backing Jack
Swofford, ex-mayor of Pittsburgh.

158
00:10:25,778 --> 00:10:27,895
He's got state-wide
name recognition

159
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:29,338
and campaign machinery
in place...

160
00:10:29,418 --> 00:10:32,490
It's been three months
and we don't have dick.

161
00:10:32,577 --> 00:10:34,375
What about the A.G.?
Ben Pluckett?

162
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,933
No, Ben's got his eyes set
on the Senate in '14.

163
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:40,135
Yeah, which he'll lose because he
botched a sex offender sting last year.

164
00:10:40,218 --> 00:10:42,608
Well, there's always McHolland.
He's 78.

165
00:10:42,698 --> 00:10:44,928
When's the last time he held office?
When Carter was president?

166
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:46,930
Reagan,
but same difference.

167
00:10:47,019 --> 00:10:49,055
Well, he has dignity.
He has gravitas.

168
00:10:49,139 --> 00:10:50,697
I mean, if you need someone
to fill Matthews' shoes...

169
00:10:50,778 --> 00:10:53,500
You can't fill Jim Matthews' shoes.
So we shouldn't even try.

170
00:10:53,938 --> 00:10:55,497
We need a fresh face.

171
00:10:55,577 --> 00:10:57,092
The state has
a weak bench.

172
00:10:57,178 --> 00:10:59,454
Well, let's go through all the
sitting Congressmen one by one,

173
00:10:59,577 --> 00:11:00,899
and see if anybody
sticks out from the crowd.

174
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:03,851
All right. I got the list right here.
Okay. Go ahead.

175
00:11:03,938 --> 00:11:06,577
Pennsylvania's first
district, Peter Russo.

176
00:11:06,658 --> 00:11:09,492
Cross him off. He's no good.
No experience. No chops.

177
00:11:09,577 --> 00:11:12,538
Okay, moving on. Second
district, Gwendolyn Pierce.

178
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:15,577
Gwen's too controversial.
Very vocal on abortion...

179
00:11:15,658 --> 00:11:16,649
And, Caroline?

180
00:11:16,818 --> 00:11:17,854
She's good.

181
00:11:17,978 --> 00:11:18,968
Yeah? How're the boys?

182
00:11:19,139 --> 00:11:20,128
All fuckin'
four of them?

183
00:11:20,218 --> 00:11:21,971
You feed 'em.

184
00:11:22,058 --> 00:11:24,370
You got any pictures?
On your phone?

185
00:11:24,457 --> 00:11:26,575
Come on. Let's cut the
shit, Pete, will ya?

186
00:11:26,698 --> 00:11:28,817
What are we gonna do
about the shipyard?

187
00:11:32,139 --> 00:11:35,130
BRAC had their hearing.
They slated it for closing.

188
00:11:35,218 --> 00:11:37,414
Yeah, and why
didn't you testify?

189
00:11:37,538 --> 00:11:39,734
We're talking
12,000 jobs here.

190
00:11:39,818 --> 00:11:42,378
My hands were tied, Paul.
People wanted it closed.

191
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,250
I was under a lot of pressure.
From who?

192
00:11:45,218 --> 00:11:47,335
People high up the food chain.
There's nothing I could do.

193
00:11:47,778 --> 00:11:51,055
That's bullshit. You go back to BRAC.
You talk to the DOD.

194
00:11:51,139 --> 00:11:53,495
You talk to the Secretary of the Navy.
You do something...

195
00:11:53,577 --> 00:11:54,568
It's not gonna happen.

196
00:11:54,698 --> 00:11:55,734
Okay, why not?

197
00:11:56,098 --> 00:11:57,452
I told you,
it's political.

198
00:11:57,538 --> 00:11:59,575
Okay, so I'm supposed to go back
to the Shipbuilder's Association

199
00:11:59,658 --> 00:12:00,933
and say what now,
exactly?

200
00:12:01,298 --> 00:12:03,938
That they're out of work because
Pete Russo's playing politics?

201
00:12:06,258 --> 00:12:07,487
I mean, Jesus, Pete.

202
00:12:07,938 --> 00:12:10,692
We're the ones who got you fuckin'
elected in the first place.

203
00:12:11,818 --> 00:12:14,207
Now you're gonna
turn your back on us?

204
00:12:14,298 --> 00:12:16,096
You should go.

205
00:12:18,178 --> 00:12:19,407
Seriously?

206
00:12:21,778 --> 00:12:23,817
I just got here.
You're kickin' me out now?

207
00:12:24,978 --> 00:12:27,698
Hey, I'm fuckin'
talkin' to you.

208
00:12:30,139 --> 00:12:31,856
I thought we
grew up together.

209
00:12:31,978 --> 00:12:35,528
But this guy, sitting
behind his big desk,

210
00:12:36,258 --> 00:12:39,217
I don't even know
who the fuck he is.

211
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,173
Where's the Pete Russo who
knew how to throw a punch

212
00:12:42,258 --> 00:12:44,774
when his back was
against the wall?

213
00:12:44,978 --> 00:12:46,935
That guy was my friend.

214
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,654
Every teacher in the country?
A month before school ends?

215
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:02,774
He doesn't need
all of them.

216
00:13:02,858 --> 00:13:04,850
Fifteen, 20 states.
That's all.

217
00:13:04,938 --> 00:13:06,975
But the AFT and the NEA
can't agree on anything.

218
00:13:07,058 --> 00:13:09,096
You underestimate
Marty Spinella.

219
00:13:10,899 --> 00:13:12,252
So which one
do we target?

220
00:13:13,978 --> 00:13:15,207
We have a better
chance with the NEA.

221
00:13:15,978 --> 00:13:17,413
You think Chuck Sloan
will bite?

222
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,649
Cooperate, we give your people
protection and a place at the banquet.

223
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,457
Fight us, we break you.

224
00:13:22,577 --> 00:13:24,173
He'll bite.
Get him on the phone.

225
00:13:24,258 --> 00:13:25,294
It's after 2:00.

226
00:13:26,058 --> 00:13:28,698
Spinella's potentially mobilizing
the largest teachers' strike

227
00:13:28,778 --> 00:13:31,053
in United States history.
Nobody's sleeping.

228
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:33,096
I'll call him
right now.

229
00:13:34,098 --> 00:13:35,851
I'm sorry.
Are we being too loud?

230
00:13:35,938 --> 00:13:37,293
A little.

231
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:41,053
What are you working on?

232
00:13:41,139 --> 00:13:43,289
The gala.
There's so much to do.

233
00:13:45,098 --> 00:13:46,134
Did Nancy
send you my list?

234
00:13:46,298 --> 00:13:47,370
She did.

235
00:13:47,457 --> 00:13:49,211
And what'd you think?

236
00:13:49,577 --> 00:13:52,491
It's a good list.
Thanks for inviting them.

237
00:13:55,298 --> 00:13:56,778
Is something wrong?

238
00:13:59,218 --> 00:14:01,938
It's still not anywhere near
what Remy brought to the table.

239
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,729
SanCorp offered
1.5 million, Francis.

240
00:14:05,818 --> 00:14:09,370
I'm adding up the numbers and
we're only at half a million.

241
00:14:09,457 --> 00:14:11,575
I got Chuck on the phone.
In a minute.

242
00:14:11,658 --> 00:14:12,694
I can make
more calls...

243
00:14:12,778 --> 00:14:14,132
Enough to raise
1.5 million?

244
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,298
Well, I can at least
get us closer.

245
00:14:18,938 --> 00:14:20,133
I'm going to bed.

246
00:14:21,938 --> 00:14:23,531
Don't move
any of this around.

247
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:27,771
Claire... We made the
decision to turn Remy down.

248
00:14:28,378 --> 00:14:30,769
No one forced you. I thought
we were okay on this.

249
00:14:30,858 --> 00:14:31,848
You're right.

250
00:14:34,258 --> 00:14:35,774
Good night, Francis.

251
00:15:20,778 --> 00:15:22,928
<i>This is Adam.
Leave a message.</i>

252
00:15:23,019 --> 00:15:25,487
Hi, Adam, it's me.
I know it's late, but...

253
00:15:28,058 --> 00:15:31,813
Well, I was really just calling to
thank you again for the photographs.

254
00:15:31,899 --> 00:15:35,289
I'm sure they're gonna be
a big hit at the auction.

255
00:15:36,658 --> 00:15:38,250
Hope you're well.

256
00:15:42,658 --> 00:15:46,129
<i>I'm sure they're gonna be
a big hit at the auction.</i>

257
00:15:47,378 --> 00:15:49,255
<i>Hope you're well.</i>

258
00:16:07,019 --> 00:16:09,408
Right this way,
Mr. Hammerschmidt.

259
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:15,168
He's here.

260
00:16:17,139 --> 00:16:18,936
Good afternoon, Tom.

261
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:25,769
Legal?

262
00:16:26,298 --> 00:16:28,529
Did you say it
or didn't you?

263
00:16:30,778 --> 00:16:33,850
To you and to
anyone who asks...

264
00:16:33,938 --> 00:16:35,133
Yes, I did.

265
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,098
Do we really
need them?

266
00:16:39,178 --> 00:16:40,737
Not unless I should
expect a fight.

267
00:16:40,818 --> 00:16:41,808
You shouldn't.

268
00:16:43,218 --> 00:16:45,096
Give us a few moments.

269
00:16:57,298 --> 00:16:59,335
It's not what
you called her.

270
00:16:59,418 --> 00:17:00,899
It's that you let her
leave the building.

271
00:17:01,258 --> 00:17:03,774
I know how to run
a paper, Margaret.

272
00:17:03,858 --> 00:17:05,655
What I don't know how
to do is run a paper

273
00:17:05,818 --> 00:17:07,616
staffed with people
I can't control.

274
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,817
Was she really
out of control?

275
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:13,173
To my understanding, she simply
turned down a new position.

276
00:17:13,298 --> 00:17:15,769
It's her attitude. It's the
way she turned it down.

277
00:17:15,857 --> 00:17:18,375
Did you think to ask her what
she'd rather do instead?

278
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:20,211
Is it my job to pander
to all my employees' wants...

279
00:17:20,298 --> 00:17:21,414
My employees.

280
00:17:23,778 --> 00:17:26,087
And if they have something
to offer that you don't,

281
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:27,531
yes, it is your job.

282
00:17:27,617 --> 00:17:29,691
We've been
through this, Tom.

283
00:17:29,778 --> 00:17:32,614
The paper's operating at a loss.
We need people like Zoe...

284
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:36,375
I'm very aware of how much
we're hurting, Margaret.

285
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,777
Staff reductions,
dip in circulation,

286
00:17:38,857 --> 00:17:42,089
each one of those faces
and every subscriber we lose,

287
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:43,614
they keep me
awake at night.

288
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:46,850
Now I... I won't argue
the business side of things.

289
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,375
It's neither my place
nor my area of expertise.

290
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:50,894
But know this,

291
00:17:52,019 --> 00:17:55,730
Zoe Barnes,
Twitter, blogs,

292
00:17:56,377 --> 00:17:59,735
enriched media,
they're all surface.

293
00:18:01,019 --> 00:18:02,500
They're fads.

294
00:18:02,897 --> 00:18:05,049
They aren't the foundation
this paper was built on,

295
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:08,097
and they aren't
what will keep it alive.

296
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:12,094
We have a core readership
that thirsts for hard news.

297
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:16,450
Those are the people I work
80 hours a week for.

298
00:18:18,857 --> 00:18:21,817
And I won't be distracted
by what's fashionable.

299
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,656
That's your
resignation letter.

300
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:35,572
Hand it to the lawyers
on the way out.

301
00:18:36,377 --> 00:18:38,451
I'll give you
some privacy.

302
00:18:40,538 --> 00:18:42,769
No, no, stay,
it'll be quick.

303
00:18:44,137 --> 00:18:45,778
We'll get a drink.

304
00:18:49,617 --> 00:18:51,576
We're gonna launch
right here in Washington.

305
00:18:51,658 --> 00:18:53,137
We'll see how
Congress likes it

306
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:56,052
when the streets are teeming
with unsupervised school kids.

307
00:18:56,538 --> 00:18:58,576
Then we'll phase out
the rest of the country.

308
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,931
Everybody, hold on for one minute.
What's up?

309
00:19:01,577 --> 00:19:02,615
The NEA is out.

310
00:19:02,778 --> 00:19:03,816
What?

311
00:19:04,058 --> 00:19:06,049
They pulled out.
Why?

312
00:19:06,137 --> 00:19:07,254
He wouldn't say.

313
00:19:09,377 --> 00:19:11,097
Hold on for
one more minute.

314
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,770
Chuck Sloan? Get him on
the phone right now.

315
00:19:12,897 --> 00:19:14,014
I've got him right here.

316
00:19:14,097 --> 00:19:15,932
Is he muted?
Yes.

317
00:19:21,058 --> 00:19:22,572
Hey, Chuck, it's Marty.

318
00:19:22,658 --> 00:19:24,889
Listen, you can't do this.

319
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:29,172
If we don't stay united now,
we don't have a...

320
00:19:29,298 --> 00:19:31,654
You hired me to represent
your interests, right?

321
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,491
How could I possibly
lobby for the teachers

322
00:19:33,577 --> 00:19:35,136
when Congress
sees us splintering

323
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:37,257
before we even
put up a unite...

324
00:19:38,897 --> 00:19:39,887
All right.

325
00:19:41,377 --> 00:19:43,097
Did Underwood
get to you?

326
00:19:43,818 --> 00:19:46,049
Frank is dishonest
and manipulative.

327
00:19:46,137 --> 00:19:48,018
You've seen that
he's lied to us already.

328
00:19:48,097 --> 00:19:51,091
Wait, Chuck?
Chuck, Chuck? Chuck!

329
00:19:53,298 --> 00:19:54,492
Son of a bitch!

330
00:19:57,418 --> 00:19:59,091
Where are you?
<i>I'm at the office.</i>

331
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,658
False.
<i>You don't believe me?</i>

332
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:01,887
Not for a second.

333
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,048
<i>Where are you?</i>

334
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:04,168
About to walk
into a meeting.

335
00:20:04,337 --> 00:20:05,375
<i>With who?</i>

336
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,687
Someone I have to punish.

337
00:20:06,778 --> 00:20:07,930
<i>Give me a name.</i>

338
00:20:08,058 --> 00:20:09,252
No names.

339
00:20:09,337 --> 00:20:10,979
<i>What did this
person do wrong?</i>

340
00:20:11,058 --> 00:20:12,491
Lie to me.

341
00:20:12,577 --> 00:20:14,651
<i>How will you
punish him?</i>

342
00:20:14,818 --> 00:20:17,377
What makes you
think it's a him?

343
00:20:19,019 --> 00:20:20,932
Hold on.
I have to take this.

344
00:20:22,778 --> 00:20:24,009
Where are you?

345
00:20:24,137 --> 00:20:25,366
<i>Me? I am...</i>

346
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:27,769
Not at the office.

347
00:20:31,418 --> 00:20:34,855
You're gonna give me a new
one of these every week?

348
00:20:35,097 --> 00:20:37,533
Well, I can't
continue to...

349
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,690
Not without protection.

350
00:20:39,818 --> 00:20:42,653
Nobody tells me when
to work and when to play.

351
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:44,730
I'm not being
unreasonable, Zoe.

352
00:20:44,818 --> 00:20:47,014
If you can't trust me, we
shouldn't be doing this at all.

353
00:20:52,577 --> 00:20:55,012
Well, then how do we
establish our trust?

354
00:20:55,097 --> 00:20:56,770
I have been very discreet.

355
00:20:56,897 --> 00:20:58,809
Professional
discretion, yes.

356
00:20:58,897 --> 00:21:02,211
But this is
new territory.

357
00:21:06,337 --> 00:21:08,454
You have a camera
on your phone.

358
00:21:15,778 --> 00:21:16,816
Pictures.

359
00:21:18,418 --> 00:21:21,490
The kind I wouldn't
want my father to see.

360
00:21:25,418 --> 00:21:28,251
Well, I'm gonna
need more than that.

361
00:21:52,857 --> 00:21:53,847
Lie back.

362
00:22:02,019 --> 00:22:03,850
Use your imagination.

363
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:11,940
I want everything
packed for tomorrow.

364
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,607
We checked already, Dad.

365
00:22:14,298 --> 00:22:17,529
Did you? Those are my pink
Nikes on the kitchen counter?

366
00:22:17,617 --> 00:22:20,337
And you, Autobot, what is Optimus
Prime doing under my bed?

367
00:22:20,418 --> 00:22:23,298
He better transform himself
into your backpack

368
00:22:23,377 --> 00:22:26,134
before you have
to leave tomorrow.

369
00:22:27,818 --> 00:22:30,892
Hey, Dad,
is Christina coming back?

370
00:22:32,298 --> 00:22:34,972
I don't... I don't
think so, buddy. No.

371
00:22:35,097 --> 00:22:36,087
Oh.

372
00:22:36,337 --> 00:22:37,533
I liked her.

373
00:22:37,617 --> 00:22:38,733
Me, too.
She's cool.

374
00:22:39,538 --> 00:22:41,415
Yeah, she is cool.

375
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:44,608
Now, you guys
gotta brush your teeth.

376
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,889
And then check
the rooms again.

377
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,856
And then it's
time for bed.

378
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,056
Got it, pumpkins?

379
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:53,250
Dad, you know I hate it
when you call us pumpkins.

380
00:22:53,857 --> 00:22:57,057
Go. Before I turn you
into a pie.

381
00:23:08,778 --> 00:23:09,769
Peter Russo.

382
00:23:13,658 --> 00:23:15,376
He's a drunk.
He is at the moment.

383
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:18,416
A very functional one.
Imagine if he was sober.

384
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,180
Even so,
you run him for Governor,

385
00:23:20,298 --> 00:23:21,812
people are going
to dig into his past.

386
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:24,575
Well, we turn that into an
asset, not a liability.

387
00:23:24,658 --> 00:23:27,653
Here's who I was,
here's who I am now.

388
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:30,616
You saw how they dismissed him in three
seconds at the Leadership meeting.

389
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:34,658
Patti Whittaker is very open-minded.
And I am very persuasive.

390
00:23:38,019 --> 00:23:39,168
You think Russo
even wants it?

391
00:23:39,259 --> 00:23:41,375
Any kid who's made it from
the streets of South Philly

392
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,691
to the Capitol
rotunda is ambitious.

393
00:23:43,778 --> 00:23:45,451
We just need
to tap into that.

394
00:23:45,538 --> 00:23:47,972
Surround him with the best people
and then build the machine

395
00:23:48,058 --> 00:23:49,288
and push the "go" button.

396
00:23:49,818 --> 00:23:50,970
So you think
he could win.

397
00:23:52,259 --> 00:23:54,693
I think he can be
a contender.

398
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:59,817
Okay, let's say we pull off
a miracle and he wins.

399
00:23:59,897 --> 00:24:00,887
What do we gain by it?

400
00:24:01,097 --> 00:24:03,135
Isn't it better to be holding
the reins in this race

401
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:05,257
than watching
from the stands?

402
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:06,493
Your wife
is on the phone.

403
00:24:06,617 --> 00:24:07,733
Put her through
in here.

404
00:24:07,818 --> 00:24:08,808
I understand
that Pennsylvania's

405
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:09,973
important for
re-districting...

406
00:24:10,058 --> 00:24:12,971
No, no, no, this isn't just
about this race, Doug.

407
00:24:13,058 --> 00:24:16,894
Expand your thinking. Who
else is from Pennsylvania?

408
00:24:19,377 --> 00:24:21,019
No, no, no,
not in Congress.

409
00:24:21,897 --> 00:24:23,298
The executive branch.

410
00:24:25,137 --> 00:24:26,413
The Vice President.

411
00:24:28,137 --> 00:24:29,288
Hello, my dear.

412
00:24:29,377 --> 00:24:32,373
Nancy had my tux dry-cleaned
so I won't embarrass...

413
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:33,778
<i>The Cotesworth
canceled on us.</i>

414
00:24:36,137 --> 00:24:38,700
I'm leaving right now. I'll come get you.
I've gotta go.

415
00:24:38,778 --> 00:24:39,733
What's going on?

416
00:24:39,818 --> 00:24:41,570
The hotel,
for tonight's gala,

417
00:24:41,658 --> 00:24:44,459
they refuse to let
Claire into the ballroom

418
00:24:44,617 --> 00:24:47,416
because their
employees are union.

419
00:24:47,538 --> 00:24:48,528
Spinella.

420
00:24:48,617 --> 00:24:51,416
Yeah, he can go after me all he wants.
But to go after my wife?

421
00:24:52,097 --> 00:24:53,213
No class.

422
00:24:53,298 --> 00:24:54,367
Meet me
at the Cotesworth.

423
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,615
You got it.

424
00:24:57,897 --> 00:24:59,809
Why can't we just move
it to another place?

425
00:24:59,897 --> 00:25:01,173
I looked into that.
Everything's booked.

426
00:25:01,259 --> 00:25:03,214
You have to reserve these
things weeks in advance.

427
00:25:03,298 --> 00:25:05,607
I got Stamper online looking
for another venue somewhere.

428
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:08,009
Francis, the delivery trucks
are already at the Cotesworth.

429
00:25:08,097 --> 00:25:10,453
I can't have people showing up
at a different place

430
00:25:10,538 --> 00:25:11,815
in case they
don't get the email.

431
00:25:11,897 --> 00:25:13,459
All right. This is my fault.
I feel awful.

432
00:25:13,538 --> 00:25:15,097
There's a half a million
on the line here.

433
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,817
I realize that.

434
00:25:16,897 --> 00:25:18,377
And I can't keep
having my work

435
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,011
take these hits
on behalf of yours.

436
00:25:20,097 --> 00:25:21,739
It's more than
just an inconvenience.

437
00:25:21,818 --> 00:25:23,730
I know.
We'll solve it.

438
00:25:31,019 --> 00:25:32,577
Hey, I just got
your email.

439
00:25:32,658 --> 00:25:33,730
What'd you think?

440
00:25:33,818 --> 00:25:36,210
You don't have to send me
things before you post.

441
00:25:36,857 --> 00:25:38,337
I thought you might
want to take a look.

442
00:25:38,418 --> 00:25:39,693
The goal here
is for everyone

443
00:25:39,778 --> 00:25:41,416
to post things faster than I
have a chance to read 'em.

444
00:25:41,538 --> 00:25:44,097
If you're satisfied with the
article, you just put it up.

445
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:45,168
Okay.

446
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:46,490
Are you satisfied?

447
00:25:46,658 --> 00:25:47,730
I think so.

448
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:49,933
Okay, you are
or you aren't.

449
00:25:50,019 --> 00:25:51,850
Whatever hoops <i>The Herald</i>
made you jump through...

450
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:54,009
I know.
Let them go.

451
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:56,297
It's okay
to be opinionated, Zoe.

452
00:25:56,377 --> 00:25:58,690
And it's okay to go outside
and get your hands dirty.

453
00:25:59,377 --> 00:26:02,019
You're no longer
tied to a desk.

454
00:26:02,137 --> 00:26:04,018
Or to that pillow for that matter.
I'm not gonna post it.

455
00:26:04,097 --> 00:26:06,567
Midterm predictions, they're not news.
They're bullshit.

456
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:08,577
Well, I agree.

457
00:26:10,097 --> 00:26:11,250
I can do better.

458
00:26:11,377 --> 00:26:12,700
I think you can.

459
00:26:13,377 --> 00:26:15,654
Feel free to blow my mind.

460
00:26:24,577 --> 00:26:27,048
If we do this event,
the whole staff walks out.

461
00:26:27,137 --> 00:26:29,049
I've got 300 guests...

462
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:31,057
You signed a contract
with my wife.

463
00:26:31,259 --> 00:26:32,577
We'll refund your
wife's organization

464
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,848
and pay for whatever the
cost of moving the event

465
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:36,452
to a more
appropriate venue.

466
00:26:36,538 --> 00:26:39,291
And we would have to refund half
a million dollars in donations.

467
00:26:39,377 --> 00:26:40,700
Can you pay
for that, too?

468
00:26:40,778 --> 00:26:42,373
'Cause I'm pretty sure there's
cause for damages here.

469
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,376
I truly apologize, sir.

470
00:26:45,617 --> 00:26:46,815
Who's your boss?

471
00:26:46,897 --> 00:26:47,970
I spoke with
the owners,

472
00:26:48,058 --> 00:26:50,096
and they authorized me
to do what I think is best.

473
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:52,214
And do they realize that
they are shutting the door

474
00:26:52,337 --> 00:26:54,772
on 41 members of
the United States Congress?

475
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:57,019
Yes, sir. They do.

476
00:26:57,097 --> 00:26:59,408
I had to make a very
hard judgment call.

477
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,887
Well, I seriously
question your judgment.

478
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:03,892
You know, word travels
fast in this town.

479
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:06,816
All those luncheons
and conventions and dinners,

480
00:27:06,897 --> 00:27:09,096
it's gonna be a shame to lose
all that work, isn't it?

481
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:11,096
Congressman,
you are absolutely right,

482
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:13,096
but if my staff
walks out, I...

483
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:16,499
Please understand
the predicament I'm in.

484
00:27:16,577 --> 00:27:17,615
<i>I got an idea.</i>

485
00:27:18,019 --> 00:27:19,293
I know what
we're gonna do.

486
00:27:19,377 --> 00:27:22,337
Honey, they're not gonna
let us have it inside,

487
00:27:22,418 --> 00:27:23,615
we're gonna
have it right here,

488
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,134
on their front steps.
Picnic style.

489
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:26,254
What do you
need from me?

490
00:27:26,377 --> 00:27:27,414
I need your manpower.

491
00:27:27,538 --> 00:27:29,019
Yes, sir, I'm on it.

492
00:27:32,298 --> 00:27:35,769
Okay, everybody, stop what
you're doing and listen up.

493
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:39,607
Yeah?

494
00:27:41,019 --> 00:27:42,212
Hey, Frank.

495
00:27:42,298 --> 00:27:43,528
<i>Listen,
I need a favor, a large one.</i>

496
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:46,058
How soon?

497
00:27:46,137 --> 00:27:47,335
<i>In about three hours.</i>

498
00:27:48,137 --> 00:27:49,971
How many people we talking?
<i>Just 300.</i>

499
00:27:50,058 --> 00:27:51,971
The florist is gonna send
over whatever he has.

500
00:27:52,058 --> 00:27:53,288
Great.

501
00:27:53,418 --> 00:27:54,646
Francis,
where are we with food?

502
00:27:54,778 --> 00:27:56,610
I've got hot dogs, pizzas,
and soul food coming.

503
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,134
Maybe something else.

504
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,810
Girls.
Here's what I want.

505
00:27:59,897 --> 00:28:03,493
I want four bars, two on each level.
The food can go there.

506
00:28:03,577 --> 00:28:05,173
The silent auction
goes here.

507
00:28:05,259 --> 00:28:07,172
And cancel the string quartet.
Let's get a DJ.

508
00:28:07,259 --> 00:28:08,614
Doug,
how are we on booze?

509
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:09,855
Kegs are on their way now.
Great.

510
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,291
And call Denise
at the office

511
00:28:11,377 --> 00:28:14,290
and have her bring every
donation envelope she can find.

512
00:28:14,418 --> 00:28:16,412
Okay, messages, people.

513
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:25,052
Congressman Russo's office. Yes, can
you hold one minute? Thank you.

514
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:27,568
Congressman? People keep
calling about the shipyards.

515
00:28:27,658 --> 00:28:28,647
We don't know
what to tell them.

516
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:29,730
We just say we'll
give you the message.

517
00:28:29,818 --> 00:28:31,334
Keep saying that.
Okay, here they are.

518
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:32,932
The messages and all the
emails we've gotten to.

519
00:28:33,019 --> 00:28:35,740
Do you want me to...
Have a good night.

520
00:28:38,538 --> 00:28:39,769
Who'd we reach?

521
00:28:39,857 --> 00:28:41,895
<i>Herald, The Times,
USA Today.</i>

522
00:28:42,019 --> 00:28:43,932
All right, I want affiliate
stations and cable news.

523
00:28:44,019 --> 00:28:46,327
I want satellite trucks out there.
I want this on live TV.

524
00:28:46,418 --> 00:28:47,568
Okay, I'm on it.

525
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:49,577
You can't
do this here.

526
00:28:49,658 --> 00:28:52,730
Zoe, 8:00 p.m. tonight,
Hotel Cotesworth.

527
00:28:53,058 --> 00:28:55,289
Benefit for
my wife's charity.

528
00:28:55,418 --> 00:28:58,538
No. Wash your face
and let your hair down.

529
00:28:59,097 --> 00:29:01,135
This is
work and play.

530
00:29:01,377 --> 00:29:02,367
See you.

531
00:29:02,538 --> 00:29:05,692
I can tell you right now
I'm gonna need two dozen.

532
00:29:11,259 --> 00:29:13,010
Paul, I'm gonna need those
by tomorrow, okay?

533
00:29:13,097 --> 00:29:15,490
Your guests are
your problem, not mine.

534
00:29:15,577 --> 00:29:16,772
Julian.

535
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:18,166
I'll close the gate.

536
00:29:19,097 --> 00:29:20,452
You know, I'm no
expert in fire code,

537
00:29:20,538 --> 00:29:22,654
but I would imagine
that locking your guests in

538
00:29:22,818 --> 00:29:24,616
is a bigger violation than
having them walk around us.

539
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:28,492
This is trespassing on private property.
You're breaking the law.

540
00:29:28,617 --> 00:29:29,654
All right. Okay.

541
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:33,289
Let me get Barney Hull
on the phone here for you.

542
00:29:36,298 --> 00:29:38,451
Here you go.
It's ringing.

543
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:41,049
Who's Barney Hull?
Police Commissioner.

544
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:43,818
<i>Commissioner Hull's office.
Hello?</i> No? Okay.

545
00:29:43,897 --> 00:29:45,491
You'd rather talk
to him in person?

546
00:29:45,577 --> 00:29:46,807
That's great.
He's coming to the party.

547
00:29:47,377 --> 00:29:49,175
I'll be sure to introduce
the two of you.

548
00:29:49,259 --> 00:29:51,855
Thanks for
your hospitality.

549
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:05,569
What do you want me to do?
I can't lock the gates.

550
00:30:05,658 --> 00:30:07,173
And they've got
the police on their side.

551
00:30:07,259 --> 00:30:09,214
Unbelievable.
Hold on.

552
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:13,693
Cassandra. I need 200 teachers
at the Cotesworth Hotel.

553
00:30:13,778 --> 00:30:14,816
Right now.

554
00:30:14,897 --> 00:30:15,887
I need a full picket.

555
00:30:16,019 --> 00:30:16,973
Two hundred?
I don't know if we can

556
00:30:17,097 --> 00:30:19,089
get that many on... I don't want to hear it.
Just get it done.

557
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:21,375
All right. I don't give a fuck if
they're teachers or not, frankly.

558
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:22,607
Just get me 200 bodies.

559
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,498
Call the Teamsters,
maybe they'll help us.

560
00:30:24,577 --> 00:30:27,652
We'll give them glasses if we have to.
Tell the guys to look smart.

561
00:30:27,818 --> 00:30:31,528
Charlie, get off the phone. I need
signs right now, at least 100.

562
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:33,374
<i>You know what?
Let them set it up.</i>

563
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:34,940
<i>It's actually better
for us that way. They...</i>

564
00:30:35,137 --> 00:30:36,572
<i>This way they
can't hide from us.</i>

565
00:30:36,658 --> 00:30:39,616
You've put me in
a terrible situation.

566
00:30:57,377 --> 00:30:59,336
Thank you very much
for all your help.

567
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:01,019
Much appreciated.

568
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:04,058
Here, we've got the signs right here.
Let's hand them out fast.

569
00:31:04,137 --> 00:31:09,134
Everybody, single file, right down the
street, this way and that way, okay?

570
00:31:17,658 --> 00:31:20,570
Well, at least
he spelled it right.

571
00:31:20,658 --> 00:31:23,934
<i>Teachers protesting the Education
Reform and Achievement Act</i>

572
00:31:24,019 --> 00:31:27,536
<i>have descended upon the Hotel
Cotesworth in Washington, D. C.</i>

573
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:31,857
<i>Union lobbyist, Marty Spinella,
organized the demonstration.</i>

574
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:34,088
Teachers deserve respect!

575
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:35,692
Teachers deserve respect!

576
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:45,817
Now, I knew you'd show up and you'd
bring that beautiful wife of yours.

577
00:31:45,897 --> 00:31:47,971
Hello, it's a pleasure,
thank you for coming.

578
00:31:48,058 --> 00:31:49,616
Come on in,
the drinks are on the house.

579
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:50,847
Felicity.

580
00:31:51,019 --> 00:31:52,212
The party can begin.

581
00:31:52,658 --> 00:31:54,219
This is Spinella.

582
00:31:54,298 --> 00:31:55,971
He got us shut out
by the union,

583
00:31:56,097 --> 00:31:58,135
so we had to have a party
out here on the steps.

584
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:59,971
I'm gonna take you
up to a bar right now.

585
00:32:00,058 --> 00:32:02,528
Thank you for coming.
Thank you. Welcome.

586
00:32:03,577 --> 00:32:05,569
Teachers, yes! Unions, yes!

587
00:32:50,097 --> 00:32:51,087
Hi.

588
00:33:00,617 --> 00:33:02,259
Thanks, again,
so much for coming.

589
00:33:06,778 --> 00:33:08,180
Adam's here.

590
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:13,209
You came.

591
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:17,812
Looks wonderful.

592
00:33:17,897 --> 00:33:19,298
You're gonna have
to move over

593
00:33:19,377 --> 00:33:22,498
because I have to serve
this wonderful couple myself.

594
00:33:22,577 --> 00:33:25,855
This is fabulous. Only Claire
could have thought of this.

595
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:29,607
I don't suppose you have
anything single-malt back there?

596
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:33,450
Frank, it's worth every penny
to see you on keg duty.

597
00:33:33,538 --> 00:33:36,931
Well then, don't you think that this
is worth just a few extra pennies?

598
00:33:37,019 --> 00:33:38,817
Let's break out
the checkbook, Charles.

599
00:33:40,259 --> 00:33:41,692
Did you RSVP?

600
00:33:41,778 --> 00:33:43,817
I assumed
it didn't matter.

601
00:33:43,897 --> 00:33:45,095
It doesn't.

602
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:47,010
I'm glad you're here.

603
00:33:47,818 --> 00:33:49,048
When I heard
your message...

604
00:33:49,137 --> 00:33:52,894
You know, I shouldn't
have left that, Adam.

605
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:54,173
Why not?

606
00:33:57,897 --> 00:33:59,730
Maybe we should
talk at some point.

607
00:34:00,259 --> 00:34:03,375
Make that check with a
lot of zeros, won't you?

608
00:34:04,019 --> 00:34:05,452
Here we are.

609
00:34:11,659 --> 00:34:13,093
Cheers.
Cheers.

610
00:34:13,179 --> 00:34:14,454
Cheers.

611
00:34:14,539 --> 00:34:17,179
Now I'm going to ask a huge
favor of you since you're here.

612
00:34:18,059 --> 00:34:19,379
You want to
put me to work.

613
00:34:19,499 --> 00:34:20,853
Yes, please.

614
00:34:20,979 --> 00:34:22,936
My pleasure.
Come.

615
00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:28,617
So these are some wonderful photographs
by an amazing photographer...

616
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:30,018
Gillian...

617
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:31,777
Adam Galloway.
Nice to meet you.

618
00:34:31,899 --> 00:34:33,492
I've heard lots about you.
And to you.

619
00:34:33,619 --> 00:34:35,896
And this is the photographer himself.
Hello, how are you?

620
00:34:38,219 --> 00:34:39,892
Freddy.

621
00:34:41,818 --> 00:34:45,608
I just wanted to thank you so much.
Such a success tonight.

622
00:34:45,699 --> 00:34:46,849
My pleasure, my pleasure.

623
00:34:47,059 --> 00:34:48,209
He's the best.

624
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:49,699
I see Adam's here.

625
00:34:49,818 --> 00:34:51,253
I didn't know
he was coming.

626
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:54,297
Well, guess what I got. Another
check from the Holburns.

627
00:34:54,379 --> 00:34:56,530
For $60,000.

628
00:35:00,419 --> 00:35:03,218
Come on, praise me
like you should.

629
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:05,659
If Frank Underwood and the
United States Congress...

630
00:35:05,739 --> 00:35:07,093
Hi, my name is Zoe Barnes.
I'm with <i>Slugline.</i>

631
00:35:07,179 --> 00:35:10,217
...think that they can dismantle the
rights of the American teacher,

632
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:13,053
well, then they are going to hear
our voices wherever they are.

633
00:35:13,139 --> 00:35:15,938
Hi, why protest here?

634
00:35:16,539 --> 00:35:18,097
Congress has to
take this seriously.

635
00:35:18,739 --> 00:35:21,539
We're here for the teachers.
We're here...

636
00:35:21,659 --> 00:35:23,093
Thank you.
Thank you.

637
00:35:24,859 --> 00:35:26,179
We're not asking
for the world.

638
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:28,296
And Congress needs to step
up and get this done.

639
00:35:42,018 --> 00:35:43,010
Excuse me,
just a moment.

640
00:35:45,459 --> 00:35:48,018
Well, that dress
looks familiar.

641
00:35:48,099 --> 00:35:50,010
It's the one I wore
to the symphony.

642
00:35:50,099 --> 00:35:52,534
Yes, the mutual
admiration society.

643
00:35:52,619 --> 00:35:54,099
That's right.

644
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,655
So. What do you
have for me?

645
00:35:57,139 --> 00:35:58,255
What do you mean?

646
00:35:58,339 --> 00:36:00,296
Well, you're surrounded
by Washington's elite.

647
00:36:00,379 --> 00:36:01,859
Are you saying
you've overheard nothing

648
00:36:01,979 --> 00:36:03,539
that could be useful
to either of us?

649
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:04,847
I'm covering
the protest.

650
00:36:04,939 --> 00:36:06,896
The rest of the world
is covering the protest.

651
00:36:06,979 --> 00:36:08,175
You may not have noticed,

652
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:10,693
but you're the only
journalist inside the party.

653
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:11,929
I've been
feeding you plenty,

654
00:36:12,018 --> 00:36:14,295
information is a two-way
street, Ms. Barnes.

655
00:36:14,499 --> 00:36:15,728
Hello...

656
00:36:15,859 --> 00:36:17,851
Claire, this is Zoe Barnes, you
met her one night at the house...

657
00:36:17,939 --> 00:36:21,330
Yes, I remember. You work
for <i>The Herald,</i> right?

658
00:36:21,619 --> 00:36:24,498
Not anymore. I actually
work at <i>Slugline</i> now.

659
00:36:24,619 --> 00:36:27,088
I've heard of it. You read
it, don't you, Francis?

660
00:36:27,179 --> 00:36:28,374
Religiously.

661
00:36:29,018 --> 00:36:32,614
Well, you seem like a very ambitious
young woman. I like that.

662
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:34,414
Doing my best.

663
00:36:34,499 --> 00:36:36,492
It's good
to see you, again.

664
00:36:37,018 --> 00:36:38,055
Please,
enjoy yourself.

665
00:36:38,179 --> 00:36:39,215
I will. Thank you.

666
00:36:39,339 --> 00:36:41,331
Take care,
Ms. Barnes.

667
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:13,177
And she
looks gorgeous,

668
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:16,975
but really she's thinking,
"When can I go the fuck home?"

669
00:39:21,179 --> 00:39:23,091
I'm off.
Already?

670
00:39:23,339 --> 00:39:25,217
I've done my duty,
I believe.

671
00:39:26,059 --> 00:39:29,939
You know me. I always have to
be the first to leave a party.

672
00:39:30,018 --> 00:39:32,010
How much did you raise?

673
00:39:32,139 --> 00:39:34,813
$750,000.

674
00:39:34,939 --> 00:39:37,215
Eighty of that was your photographs.
Fantastic.

675
00:39:37,339 --> 00:39:40,172
Write a check for 250,
we'll break a million.

676
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:41,534
Nice try.

677
00:39:44,859 --> 00:39:48,376
Thank you for coming.
And everything that you did.

678
00:39:54,539 --> 00:39:56,053
Call me sometime.

679
00:39:56,859 --> 00:39:58,498
I will.

680
00:40:00,139 --> 00:40:01,255
Teachers should
be getting more!

681
00:40:01,339 --> 00:40:02,489
So what does
a Clean Water gala

682
00:40:02,619 --> 00:40:03,689
have to do with
teachers unions?

683
00:40:03,859 --> 00:40:07,648
Well, we have over 50 members of
Congress gathered in one place.

684
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:09,617
But the fact that
these members of Congress

685
00:40:09,699 --> 00:40:12,498
are promoting pouring money
out of the country

686
00:40:12,579 --> 00:40:15,617
while neglecting their teachers
at home is precisely the problem.

687
00:40:15,699 --> 00:40:18,931
But this is private money,
not public tax dollars, so...

688
00:40:19,059 --> 00:40:20,652
But we're not
protesting the cause,

689
00:40:20,739 --> 00:40:24,255
we're protesting the Congressmen
and women themselves...

690
00:40:24,339 --> 00:40:25,773
Are these even
teachers picketing?

691
00:40:25,899 --> 00:40:27,811
Sure, some of them. And
some of them are people...

692
00:40:27,899 --> 00:40:29,414
Excuse me...

693
00:40:31,059 --> 00:40:33,780
Frank... What you... Don't take the food.
We'll feed you later.

694
00:40:33,899 --> 00:40:36,255
Don't take this food. Marty,
you know that old saying,

695
00:40:36,339 --> 00:40:37,853
"The most dangerous
spot in the world is

696
00:40:37,979 --> 00:40:39,459
"to come between
a Teamster and free food."

697
00:40:39,899 --> 00:40:42,209
Don't take the food,
we're feeding you later.

698
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:44,575
I'll take it.
She'll take it.

699
00:40:45,419 --> 00:40:46,978
Who else is hungry?

700
00:40:47,339 --> 00:40:48,455
There you go.

701
00:40:48,818 --> 00:40:49,889
Pass it back.

702
00:40:50,339 --> 00:40:51,534
Plenty more coming, guys.

703
00:40:52,818 --> 00:40:54,731
I know you've all been
out here for hours.

704
00:40:54,818 --> 00:40:56,572
Thank you, Freddy!

705
00:40:56,659 --> 00:40:58,776
The best ribs in D.C.

706
00:41:01,419 --> 00:41:03,614
Marty, come on. You've said your
piece, you got on the news.

707
00:41:03,739 --> 00:41:04,775
Come and enjoy yourself.

708
00:41:04,939 --> 00:41:06,577
I respect you, Claire,
you know I can't do that.

709
00:41:06,659 --> 00:41:09,414
Doesn't matter what side you're
on, everybody's gotta eat.

710
00:41:09,499 --> 00:41:11,297
You can have a plate of ribs.
Yes, you can.

711
00:41:11,419 --> 00:41:12,739
Come on. Yes, you can. I can't.

712
00:41:12,859 --> 00:41:14,532
Thank you, Claire, but I cannot.
You can do it.

713
00:41:14,619 --> 00:41:16,133
Come on, Marty!
Come on.

714
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:17,818
I can't. Thank you.
Thank you.

715
00:41:18,099 --> 00:41:20,010
Freddy's.
You should go to Freddy's.

716
00:41:28,979 --> 00:41:30,891
<i>Several dozen
union sympathizers,</i>

717
00:41:31,018 --> 00:41:32,931
<i>led by labor lobbyist,
Martin Spinella,</i>

718
00:41:33,099 --> 00:41:34,772
<i>attempted to disrupt the gala.</i>

719
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:36,771
<i>They need to step
up to the plate</i>

720
00:41:36,939 --> 00:41:38,896
<i>and take care of our
teachers and our children.</i>

721
00:41:39,018 --> 00:41:41,376
<i>The protest dissipated
when fundraiser attendees</i>

722
00:41:41,459 --> 00:41:43,416
<i>offer food and drink
to picketers.</i>

723
00:41:43,499 --> 00:41:45,968
<i>Doesn't matter what side you're
on, everybody's gotta eat.</i>

724
00:41:46,659 --> 00:41:47,649
Turn it off.

725
00:41:47,739 --> 00:41:49,617
<i>It's unclear
whether protest will continue.</i>

726
00:41:51,219 --> 00:41:52,448
What now?

727
00:41:59,419 --> 00:42:02,810
Call the union leadership
and the chapter presidents.

728
00:42:04,018 --> 00:42:05,612
See if they're ready
to the pull the trigger.

729
00:42:05,699 --> 00:42:08,498
If they are, we strike
at midnight tomorrow.

730
00:42:36,419 --> 00:42:38,695
You were
extraordinary.

731
00:42:38,818 --> 00:42:40,253
Tomorrow, people
who weren't there

732
00:42:40,379 --> 00:42:41,859
are gonna lie
and say they were.

733
00:42:43,459 --> 00:42:44,449
What are you reading?

734
00:42:48,739 --> 00:42:50,219
She can write.

735
00:42:51,499 --> 00:42:52,693
She can.

736
00:42:55,099 --> 00:42:57,056
And you can
raise money.

737
00:42:58,059 --> 00:43:00,130
Always,
for a good cause.

738
00:43:01,379 --> 00:43:02,369
Thank you.

739
00:43:22,939 --> 00:43:24,896
Wait in the car, please.

740
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:28,577
Hold on.
I know who that is.

741
00:43:34,899 --> 00:43:36,414
Hello, Peter.

742
00:43:41,459 --> 00:43:43,416
I am starving.
I forgot to eat.

743
00:43:44,018 --> 00:43:45,419
Would you like something,
Peter?

744
00:43:45,579 --> 00:43:46,934
No, thanks.

745
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:48,215
You should eat.

746
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:49,335
Don't fight.
She'll win.

747
00:43:49,459 --> 00:43:50,495
I will.

748
00:43:51,419 --> 00:43:52,739
Okay, yes.

749
00:43:53,539 --> 00:43:54,734
You want
some coffee?

750
00:43:54,939 --> 00:43:56,168
Yes, thanks.

751
00:43:56,659 --> 00:43:58,651
Do you have
any children?

752
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:02,251
Two. A son and a daughter.

753
00:44:04,619 --> 00:44:05,609
Married?

754
00:44:06,419 --> 00:44:07,739
Divorced.

755
00:44:09,419 --> 00:44:11,092
What are their names,
your kids?

756
00:44:11,459 --> 00:44:15,419
There's Sarah. She's 11,
and Kevin is eight.

757
00:44:16,939 --> 00:44:17,929
Do you have any pictures?

758
00:44:23,459 --> 00:44:25,768
Fuck!
I lost my phone...

759
00:44:26,619 --> 00:44:28,850
Sorry, I should...
I gotta go...

760
00:44:28,939 --> 00:44:29,929
Peter, sit down.

761
00:44:30,059 --> 00:44:31,254
You're gonna
enjoy your sandwich,

762
00:44:31,339 --> 00:44:33,012
have some coffee
and stay the night.

763
00:44:37,099 --> 00:44:38,374
Milk and sugar?

764
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:41,409
Black.

765
00:44:42,818 --> 00:44:43,809
Some fresh towels.

766
00:44:44,499 --> 00:44:46,252
There should be
soap and toothpaste,

767
00:44:46,379 --> 00:44:48,132
everything you
need in the bathroom.

768
00:44:48,339 --> 00:44:50,251
Thank you so
much for doing this.

769
00:44:50,339 --> 00:44:51,978
It's nothing.
Sleep well.

770
00:45:01,419 --> 00:45:02,455
What's going on, Peter?

771
00:45:07,179 --> 00:45:08,613
Talk to me.

772
00:45:12,619 --> 00:45:15,010
You think fresh towels
changes anything?

773
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:21,249
Changes what?

774
00:45:21,339 --> 00:45:22,329
The shipyard.

775
00:45:25,339 --> 00:45:29,175
If I was home and you pulled that
shit, I'd beat the fuck out of you.

776
00:45:30,419 --> 00:45:33,617
I would crack your skull
on the pavement.

777
00:45:34,099 --> 00:45:35,533
That's why I came
over here today.

778
00:45:35,619 --> 00:45:38,293
To fuck you up for
what you made me do.

779
00:45:39,379 --> 00:45:40,608
I don't care how nice
you're being to me.

780
00:45:40,699 --> 00:45:41,689
I don't give a shit.

781
00:45:42,179 --> 00:45:44,010
I'm gonna
wake up tomorrow,

782
00:45:45,859 --> 00:45:47,213
and all these people,

783
00:45:53,219 --> 00:45:54,699
all my friends,

784
00:45:56,899 --> 00:45:58,094
are still fucked.

785
00:45:59,899 --> 00:46:01,253
And I'm still fucked.

786
00:46:04,619 --> 00:46:06,611
You fucked all of us.

787
00:46:07,979 --> 00:46:10,289
But I'm gonna
get blamed for it.

788
00:46:11,619 --> 00:46:14,373
So, now I have to carry that
weight on my shoulders.

789
00:46:23,419 --> 00:46:25,217
You fucked me, Frank.

790
00:46:27,099 --> 00:46:29,251
I shouldn't have let you
do it, but I did...

791
00:46:48,539 --> 00:46:50,178
Are you done now?

792
00:46:53,419 --> 00:46:55,092
Get up.

793
00:46:59,139 --> 00:47:00,129
No.

794
00:47:00,219 --> 00:47:02,893
I said get up.
And follow me.

795
00:47:03,739 --> 00:47:04,809
Now.

796
00:47:20,939 --> 00:47:21,929
Get in.

797
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:25,609
Take off your clothes
and get in.

798
00:47:25,699 --> 00:47:26,689
Do it. Now.

799
00:47:47,419 --> 00:47:51,050
There was a DNC meeting earlier this week.
About the Governor's race.

800
00:47:51,499 --> 00:47:53,695
Your name came up as someone
we might want to run.

801
00:47:56,179 --> 00:47:58,056
Aspirin. Go ahead.

802
00:48:02,018 --> 00:48:04,409
Everyone in that room wanted
to cross you off the list.

803
00:48:04,499 --> 00:48:06,172
I said no.
I stuck up for you.

804
00:48:06,499 --> 00:48:08,172
I said, "Peter Russo,
he's got potential.

805
00:48:09,539 --> 00:48:12,054
"He's young, he's capable,
he's going places."

806
00:48:14,018 --> 00:48:16,329
I made them keep you
in contention.

807
00:48:16,579 --> 00:48:18,617
You're still
on that list.

808
00:48:20,059 --> 00:48:24,531
You show up at my house in the middle
of the night, drunk, to whine?

809
00:48:25,379 --> 00:48:27,371
To try to shift
the blame on me?

810
00:48:27,459 --> 00:48:30,850
Instead of taking responsibility
for yourself and your own actions?

811
00:48:32,818 --> 00:48:34,014
Maybe they were right
in that meeting.

812
00:48:36,659 --> 00:48:38,059
Maybe you are worthless.

813
00:48:41,018 --> 00:48:43,614
I'm the only person who
believes in you, Peter,

814
00:48:43,699 --> 00:48:46,168
but maybe
that's one too many.

815
00:48:48,699 --> 00:48:50,896
The hot water will
open up your capillaries.

816
00:48:51,179 --> 00:48:53,693
The aspirin you just took
will make your blood thinner.

817
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:55,691
It's up to you, Peter...

818
00:48:57,619 --> 00:48:59,975
And if you do decide to
take the coward's way out,

819
00:49:00,139 --> 00:49:03,893
cut along the tracks, not across them.
That's a rookie mistake.

820
00:49:24,659 --> 00:49:26,332
Morning.
Morning.

821
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:29,579
You need a lift
to the Hill?

822
00:49:29,659 --> 00:49:31,172
I should go home
and change my clothes.

823
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:32,931
No, no,
we'll drop you.

824
00:49:33,818 --> 00:49:35,572
You want some coffee?

825
00:49:47,739 --> 00:49:48,729
Frank?

826
00:49:48,818 --> 00:49:49,809
One month.

827
00:49:51,499 --> 00:49:52,489
Hmm?

828
00:49:52,619 --> 00:49:54,452
One month sober.

829
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:01,768
I can give you that.

830
00:50:03,179 --> 00:50:04,977
Not for me. For you.

831
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:12,335
Has the seed
been planted?

832
00:50:12,659 --> 00:50:15,175
Only Peter can
answer that question.

833
00:50:15,459 --> 00:50:16,813
He has a choice.

834
00:50:17,459 --> 00:50:18,734
Will he wither?

835
00:50:18,818 --> 00:50:20,731
Or will he thrive?

836
00:50:21,219 --> 00:50:22,652
Only time will tell.
